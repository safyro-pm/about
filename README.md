## 🚀 What We're Building

SAFYRO is revolutionizing project management by refusing to force teams into methodology lock-in.

Most PM tools make you choose: **Waterfall OR Agile**. Never both.

We give you **both** — on the same data:

- ✓ **Professional Gantt charts** with dependencies, critical path, and baseline tracking
- ✓ **True Kanban boards** with WIP limits, flow metrics, and CFD charts  
- ✓ **Budget tracking** built-in (no Excel exports)
- ✓ **Switch between views** seamlessly using the same underlying data
- ✓ **One platform, zero methodology lock-in**

## 🎯 Built For

**Teams up to 500 employees** in engineering, manufacturing, consulting, and tech who:
- Need Gantt precision for planning and stakeholder reporting
- Need Kanban speed for execution and daily workflow
- Are tired of forced methodology choices
- Want one source of truth across both approaches

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

Real teams are **hybrid** by nature:
- Mechanical engineering needs Gantt (timelines, dependencies)
- Software development needs Kanban (sprints, continuous flow)
- Leadership needs unified visibility across both

**But existing tools force you to choose one or the other.**

SAFYRO gives you **methodology freedom**.
